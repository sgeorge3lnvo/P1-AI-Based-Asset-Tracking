# AI-Based-Asset-Tracking
Computer Vision Intern Project for Summer 2024

In this project, Intel Geti will be utilized to train a classificiation/identification model, creating the ability to place any of our systems in front of a camera and have our AI model detect what system it is, the OEM ID assigned to the system, and its location status.

There are 3 location status options that we will be looking for:
  -checking if the system is going back into storage
  -checking if the system is going to someone in the lab
  -checking if the system is being shipped out somewhere


This project will also allow update of the inventory log.
